# First_words

Analysis and visualization of Kid's first words. When my Kid started talking I decided to record the first 1000 words he said with timestamp and language.
See the full story here: [Analysis of the Process of Language Acquisition of a Bilingual Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8islIa40Do). 

Here are the scripts I used to analyse the data and create the plots for the talk. 
- `1000Words_analysis.ipynb`: includes the basic processing of the data and the first analyses about vocabulary increase and appearance of type of words. 



- `1000Words_semantic_space.ipynb`: expands the analysis to the appearance of duplicated words and the exploration of semantic space.
